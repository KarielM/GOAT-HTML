                This proverb is a great description of Ochiai-sensei because to everyone that meets
                her her kindness has a lasting impact. 
                I've had tons of teachers that have made an impact,
                but to me Ochiai-sensei will always be the GOAT because
                of her exceeding kindness. She was a demanding teacher,
                but she went above and beyond for the students she believed
                capable of meeting her demands. To avoid me falling behind in my
                degree because of conflicting scheduling, Ochiai-sensei spoke to 
                my Korean professor and the Dean of Modern Languages to make an 
                exception that allowed me to take both classes coupled with
                one on one tutoring to make up for the one day I had to be in my other class.
                She wrote my recommendation letter(s) for me when I applied to study abroad,
                to join the military, and for my first job. She researched Universities
                and programs that would allow me to travel to Japan. She even gave
                me her shoes when broke my sandals after a fall so that I wouldn't have to walk 
                back to my dorm barefoot. Since she also provided support to Japanese students
                studying at the university, she dealt with hundreds of students yearly, 
                but she went out of her way for all the students she believed in.
